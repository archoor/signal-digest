# SignalDigest

> **English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> One-liner: an open-source **App review signal weekly digest** system. Add your App Store / Google Play links plus 1–3 competitor apps; the system ingests reviews on a schedule, detects complaints, praise, rating shifts, release impact, and competitor moves, then delivers a **What changed?** weekly report with prioritized next actions.

First product line: **SignalDigest for App Reviews**. The primary deliverable is a high-quality weekly email—not a complex dashboard.

## About This Project

**SignalDigest is a framework project** for the *App review change-monitoring & weekly digest* direction—not a finished commercial product.

It provides a runnable scaffold: backend pipeline (ingest → classify → diff → LLM digest → review → email), admin UI, and extension points for new data sources. **Features will be added incrementally**; some modules are stubs or MVP-quality by design.

Use it to self-host, learn the architecture, or as a starting point for customization.

## 1. Current Status

**Phase 1 (App Store MVP) framework** is in place and evolving:

- Backend: tables, App Store RSS ingest, classification, digest generation, email delivery, scheduler, settings API.
- Frontend: Next.js admin UI (monitor / reviews / digest review & send / runtime settings). See [`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md).
- Stubs or not yet production-ready: Google Play ingest, App Store Connect, Apify, Notion export, Alembic migrations, billing.

> This repo will be **updated step by step**. Star or watch if you follow this direction.

> Naming note: the design doc calls the backend `data-service`; this repo uses `backend/` because it owns API, scheduling, LLM, and email—not just data.

## 3. Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI + SQLModel |
| Database | SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) |
| Scheduler | APScheduler (in-process) |
| LLM | LiteLLM (OpenAI / Claude / DeepSeek / Gemini) |
| Email | SMTP / Resend / console |
| Ingestion | App Store public RSS (MVP); Google Play / Apify later |
| Package manager | uv |
| Frontend | Next.js 16 (App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind) |

---

## 4. Quick Start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Node.js 18+. Commands use PowerShell.

### Backend

```powershell
cd backend
copy .env.example .env
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

- Health: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
- Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Frontend (admin UI)

```powershell
cd frontend
copy .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Admin UI: http://localhost:3000

### Minimal end-to-end loop

1. Search and add a monitored app by name (admin UI **Monitor → Add**, or API):

```powershell
# Search
Invoke-RestMethod "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/apps/search?q=Notion&country=us"

# Create with platform IDs (iOS + Android in one monitor)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/apps -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{"name":"Demo","app_store_id":"389801252","google_play_package":"notion.id","country_codes":["us"]}'
```

Configure **Settings → Weekly report recipient email** (`DIGEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL`) before sending digests.

2. Ingest reviews: `POST /api/apps/{id}/ingest` (auto-classifies new reviews)
3. Generate digest: `POST /api/digests/generate?app_id={id}` (requires `LLM_API_KEY`)
4. View digest: `GET /api/digests?app_id={id}`

---

## 5. API Overview (design doc §10)

| Module | Method | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Apps | GET | `/api/apps/search?q=` |
| Apps | GET / POST | `/api/apps` |
| Apps | GET / PATCH | `/api/apps/{id}` |
| Apps | POST | `/api/apps/{id}/ingest` |
| Apps | POST | `/api/apps/{id}/classify` |
| Competitors | GET / POST | `/api/apps/{id}/competitors` |
| Competitors | DELETE | `/api/competitors/{id}` |
| Reviews | GET | `/api/reviews?app_id=&platform=` |
| Reviews | GET | `/api/reviews/stats?app_id=&platform=` |

| Digests | POST | `/api/digests/generate` / `/api/digests/{id}/send` |
| Settings | GET / PATCH | `/api/settings` (LLM / email / scheduler; persists to `.env`) |

CORS for the frontend is controlled by `CORS_ORIGINS` (`.env`), defaulting to `http://localhost:3000`.

## 6. Core Data Flow

```text
Ingest → normalize & dedupe → classify (ReviewInsight) → week-over-week diff → LLM digest → review → email
```

- Ingestion: `services/ingestion/*` via `ReviewIngestor` (new source ~1 day to add)
- Dedupe key: `platform + external_review_id` (sha256 fallback when no stable id)
- Digest: fixed JSON `sections` + evidence review ids per insight
- Delivery: only `status=approved` reports are sent

---

## 7. Development Plan

Roadmap for this framework. Items may shift; completed work stays in git history.

### Phase 1 — App Store MVP framework *(mostly done, ongoing polish)*

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App Store RSS ingestion | Done | Default `us`; multi-country configurable |
| Review normalize & dedupe | Done | `platform + external_review_id` |
| LLM classification + rule fallback | Done | LiteLLM batch + cost controls |
| Week-over-week change detection | Done | Feeds digest generator |
| LLM weekly digest (JSON sections) | Done | Evidence review ids per insight |
| Email delivery (SMTP / Resend / console) | Done | Only `approved` → send |
| Digest review workflow (draft → sent) | Done | Admin UI + PATCH status rules |
| Scheduler (daily ingest / weekly digest) | Done | Configurable via settings API |
| Admin UI (monitor / reports / settings) | Done | Next.js + icon-based review actions |
| Alembic migrations | Planned | Replace `create_all` for production |

### Phase 2 — Coverage & data reliability

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Google Play ingestor | Done | `google-play-scraper`; dual-platform ingest |
| App Store Connect API (own apps) | Planned | Higher stability for customer apps |
| Google Play Developer API (own apps) | Planned | Official auth path |
| Apify / third-party review API adapter | Planned | Stub exists in `ingestion/apify_adapter.py` |

## 8. TODO (near-term)

- [x] LiteLLM review classification (batch + rule fallback + cost control)
- [x] Email delivery (SMTP / Resend / console)
- [x] Frontend (Next.js admin UI: monitor / reviews / digest review & send)
- [x] Google Play ingestor
- [x] App name search onboarding (iTunes + Google Play)
- [x] Global digest recipient email in settings
- [x] Review highlights (praise / complaints with analysis)
- [ ] Notion export
- [ ] Alembic migrations (replace `create_all`)

### Implemented details

**Classification (§6.4 / §9.4)**  
When `ENABLE_LLM_CLASSIFICATION=true` and `LLM_API_KEY` is set, reviews are classified in batches via LiteLLM (`sentiment`, `intent`, `feature_area`, `priority`, `summary`). On failure or missing key, rule-based fallback from star ratings keeps the pipeline running. Classification runs after ingest (manual or scheduled) or via `POST /api/apps/{id}/classify`.

**Email (§7.3)**  
`EMAIL_PROVIDER`: `smtp` (STARTTLS/SSL), `resend`, or `console` (log-only for local dev). Only `approved` digests are sent; success → `sent`, failure → `failed`. HTML template reads like an email, not a BI dashboard.
